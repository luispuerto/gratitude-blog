## About me

If you really want to know more about me you should visit my main site [luispuerto.net][], especially the [about me][About Me] section. However, I can just give you a little appetizer. 

I'm a Forest Engineer from the Spanish Atlantic Northwest, that besides of being interested on trees and nature is interested in Science and Technology, and more recently in Data Science and Coding. Since 2013 I've been living outside of Spain, mainly in the Nordics, but also in other places across Europe and in the US. Right now, I'm heading to Switzerland where I'm going to start a new adventure with my family. 

## About the blog

As I've mentioned in the [home page][home], this blog is a direct consequence of a Kurzgesagt video about dissatisfaction where they where advocating about gratitude as a science-based solution to it. If you haven't watched the video, you should, and you can find it below.

After I watched the video I thought that practicing gratitude was a really neat idea, even if you aren't dissatisfied, and since the journal to practice it was so beautiful, I decided to buy it to start at some point to practice gratitude.

Since life is complicated, even more when you just have had a kid, it was until May 1 that I started this web and started my trip to gratitude journaling. 

## Why I'm writing this blog? 

Besides of thinking that practicing gratitude journaling is a great idea, I think doing it in the open could be also an interesting one. Why? Well, first, in general I don't have anything to hide and secondly because I'm really inclined to share and I think it's a good way set an example.
